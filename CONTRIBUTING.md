# Welcome to contribute

Very thanks for all of you interested in contributing!

### What can I contribute?

It's always welcomed to join us as a developer. Please check [Stock Prediction](https://github.com/users/jingedawang/projects/2) project and see what you could do.

Currently, we are in Iteration Hachthon (8/15/2022 to 9/26/2022).
Our first goal is to develop an initial version of StockPredictor, which could tell us how much the price will be in the next two weeks.

If you don't like our development plan but have good ideas about this project, please create an issue.
If you implemented what you want, we are happy to merge it.
