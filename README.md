# StockPredictor
Predict the stock price with AI models.

This is the main repository of the [Stock Prediction](https://github.com/users/jingedawang/projects/2) project, which starts as an [internal project](https://hackbox.microsoft.com/project/597) in Microsoft Hackthon 2022.

## Background

Everyone loves stock. Everyone hates stock.

It's so hard to figure out which direction the price will go in next few weeks. If you are a technical analyst, you may be interested in leveraging AI to dig the potential pattern of a given stock.

MSRA has open-sourced a powerful tool for quantitative investment, which is called [Qlib](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib). We could try to use this framework to construct a useful service for our daily trading.

A simple scenario may like,

**Me**: Please tell me how much the stock xxx will rise at the end of the next 2 weeks?
<br>**Service**: It will decrease 8% from now till that time.
<br>**Me**: Oh shit, I will sell them!

## Quick Start

This project is under development, please stay informed.

## Contribute

### What can I contribute?

It's always welcomed to join us as a developer. Please check [Stock Prediction](https://github.com/users/jingedawang/projects/2) project and see what you could do.

Currently, we are in Iteration Hachthon (8/15/2022 to 9/26/2022).
Our first goal is to develop an initial version of StockPredictor, which could tell us how much the price will be in the next two weeks.

If you don't like our development plan but have good ideas about this project, please create an issue.
We are happy to merge good implementations.
