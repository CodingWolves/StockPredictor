# StockPredictor
Predict the stock price with AI models.

This is the main repository of the [Stock Prediction](https://github.com/users/jingedawang/projects/2) project, which starts as an [internal project](https://hackbox.microsoft.com/project/597) in Microsoft Hackthon 2022.

## Background

Everyone loves stock. Everyone hates stock.

It's so hard to figure out which direction the price will go in next few weeks. If you are a technical analyst, you may be interested in leveraging AI to dig the potential pattern of a given stock.

MSRA has open-sourced a powerful tool for quantitative investment, which is called [Qlib](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib). We could try to use this framework to construct a useful service for our daily trading.

A simple scenario may like,

**Me**: Please tell me how much the stock xxx will rise at the end of the next 2 weeks?
<br>**Service**: It will decrease 8% from now till that time.
<br>**Me**: Oh shit, I will sell them!

## Quick Start
